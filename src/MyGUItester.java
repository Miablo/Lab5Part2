/*
(5 pts) Complete an animated GUI testing tool for the previous GUI.jar file.
Your tool window is placed at the upper left corner of the screen.
The window includes three buttons: “Record”, “Stop” and “Play”.
The “Record” button stores all the mouse move and press events for activities inside the MyGUI window.
The “Stop” button terminates the recording.
The “Play” button executes the recorded steps based on the same time progression.
Run the first 10 test cases that were prepared by your team last week
